const is not meant to be changed, let is meant to change, var is for older browsers.

*{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
html, body{height: 100%}
#container{min-height: 100%}
#main{overflow: auto;
padding-bottom: 100px;}
#footer{background-color: bisque;
position: relative; height: 100px; margin-top: -100px; clear: both;}
along with putting the body in two layers of div tags container and main and naming the footer is how to get the footer to work. 

margin
in the head theres a meta charset utf-8 or something like that and thats what you use for
<script src="rockpaperscissors.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
at the bottom of the page
